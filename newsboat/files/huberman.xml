   <media:description>This is an excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode with David Goggins.

It’s a brutally direct, mechanistic, and actionable discussion about how to embrace, confront, and control the dialogue in your mind — paying specific attention to the negative voices as a way to transmute all that into successful real-world behavior. Daily.

One thing is made clear: there is no way to avoid internal agony if your goal is to be the ultimate version of yourself.

The good news is that anyone can do it, but it requires going inward. Over and over again. David explains how.

He also explains how people get distracted by the observable things in others — choosing to point their fingers at others, criticize, focus on hacks, etc, as a way to avoid doing the real internal work for themselves.

The episode is a roadmap anyone can apply to better themselves, but only if they are willing to embrace the full reality of their deepest self-doubts, fears, shame, and darkness. As David explains, that’s the basement and the place from where true growth starts.

   <media:description>In this episode, I explain the biology of the common cold and flu (influenza) and how the immune system combats these infections. 

I describe behavior, nutrition and supplementation-based tools supported by peer-reviewed research to enhance immune system function and better combat colds and flu. I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. 

I explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. 

I discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. 

This episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is David Goggins, retired Navy SEAL, highly accomplished ultramarathoner, best-selling author, and influential public speaker.

David explains how he mastered his inner dialogue to build extraordinary levels of discipline and mental and physical toughness.

He describes how confronting his early hardships, including physical and mental abuse, learning disorders, and obesity, became a practice of deep and excruciating self-reflection — eventually allowing him to transmute those experiences into a superhuman work ethic.

This conversation is a unique window into David Goggins’ process in that it focuses both on the underlying science and how David manages and directs his inner dialogue.

It’s a conversation that will inform and inspire anyone wondering how exactly to go about building discipline and confidence and reach their potential.
 
Note: This conversation includes profanity. Some content might not be suitable for all audiences and ages.

   <media:description>Welcome to a special edition of the 14th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.

If you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-14-2023-philanthropy-evening-routine-light-therapy-health-metrics-more

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is Rick Rubin, world-renowned music producer of numerous award-winning artists, including Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, Adele, Eminem, Slayer, and many more. Rick is also the host of the podcast Tetragrammaton and the author of the best-selling book about the creative process entitled “The Creative Act: A Way of Being.” In this Q&amp;A episode, Rick explains the practical aspects of the creative process, such as specific morning and daily routines, the role of movement, and how to source and capture ideas, interpret dreams, and generate work-life balance. He also offers advice for those struggling with creative or motivation blocks. He explains how cultivating relationships with the unknown, uncertainty and life circumstances heightens the creative process. Rick’s insights into accessing your artistic spirit and direction apply to everyone and all realms of art, work, and life.

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

   <media:description>Recently I had the pleasure of hosting a live event in Chicago, IL. This event was part of a lecture series called The Brain Body Contract. My favorite part of the evening was the question &amp; answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&amp;A from our event in Chicago, IL at The Chicago Theatre.

We'll be hosting four live events in Australia in February 2024. Limited tickets remain for our show in Melbourne on February 10, 2024, and our second show in Sydney at the Aware Super Theatre on February 18, 2024. For tickets and event details, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/events.

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Karen Parker, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and director of the Social Neurosciences Research Program at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss the biology of social connections and bonding in babies, children and adults. Dr. Parker explains our current understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders: what they are, why the incidence of autism has increased so dramatically in recent years and both the current and emerging treatments for autism. We also discuss the condition formerly called “Asperger’s.” This episode ought to be highly relevant for anyone interested in child and human development, how social bonds form, and to those curious about autism and other spectrum conditions.

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one’s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert’s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one’s relationship with the self, others and society.

   <media:description>Welcome to a preview of the 13th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast  — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation. 

If you're an existing Premium member, you can log in to access the full episode at https://hubermanlab.supercast.com. 

If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

   <media:description>In this excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode "How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning &amp; Performance," I explain how to stop hiccups using a science-supported tool. Hiccups are caused by spasming of the phrenic nerve to diaphragm connection. Based on the way the phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm, you can stop that spasm by inhaling three times in a row with no exhales in between, then holding your breath for 15 to 30 seconds, and then slowly exhaling. 

Done correctly, this should eliminate hiccups the first time and every time, but if it's a severe spasm, you may have to repeat it a few times. All the other purported methods out there, such as drinking a glass of water backward, upside down, or scaring someone, etc., are all designed to adjust the pattern of diaphragmatic control by the brain. The technique described here actually does that.

   <media:description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.

   <media:description>In this episode, I explain a specific writing protocol shown in hundreds of scientific studies to significantly improve immediate and long-term health. I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day. I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking better mental and/or physical health through the use of brief yet highly effective science-supported protocols.

   <media:description>Recently I had the pleasure of hosting a live event in Toronto, ON. This event was part of a lecture series called The Brain Body Contract. My favorite part of the evening was the question &amp; answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&amp;A from our event in Toronto, ON at Meridian Hall. 

We'll be hosting four live events in Australia in February 2024. Limited tickets remain for our show in Melbourne on February 10, 2024, and Brisbane on February 24, 2024. Our show in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House sold out quickly, so we've added a second show at the Aware Super Theatre on February 18, 2024. For tickets and event details, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/events.
