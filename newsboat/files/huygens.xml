   <media:description>This simulation shows a spatially- and temporally incoherent wave emitter that consists of around 100 individual wave sources. The sources are continuous but all have a slightly different emission wavelength. This results is the emission field and intensity distributions shown in the video.
The simulation was made using a python script supplied by @DiffractionLimited

   <media:description>This short shows a directional wave source that is made by spacing omnidirectional wave emitters in a very specific configuration. The animations were created using the wave simulation code made by @DiffractionLimited

As for the question at the end of the video about being able to spot how destructive interference comes about: this is basically impossible to see in the animation. So the answer to the question is NO. 
However, there are few ways that you can look at how the phenomenon comes about:
1) When moving away in the horizontal direction of a row of emitters, for every point there is an equal amount of emitters that has a particular phase, compared to the emitters that have a phase 180 degrees shifted. So, when adding up these 2 contributions for all the emitters together in a row, this results in a wave amplitude that is almost zero in this direction.
2) An alternative way to look at this is the following: because of the spatial separation of exactly 1 lambda in the vertical direction, a standing wave arises in the array that has almost equal field strength in the horizontal direction within the array. And because the sources are moving in phase with the standing wave, they cannot transfer energy into the surrounding field in the horizontal direction. This also explains why a low intensity in the horizontal direction exists.

Both views are in my opinion valid, but I think the second one is a bit more intuitive.

This book series is absolutely awesome. They made me enjoy my high school physics classes and that is why I held on to them for 40 years.

The video contains a short audio clip that is inspired on "another one bites the dust" by Queen. I did not use the original drums and bass but, Freddy himself did contribute in his own special way. I consider this fair use but if you are the copyright owner, please contact me in case you consider this a copyright breach. Today on the date of video publication it is 32 years ago exactly that Freddy Mercury died of Aids. 

Apparently, the lady in the compression images is named Lena. If I had known the history behind the image and why it became so famous, I would probably not have used it:

A correction about the name of ASML: currently, this is the actual name of the company, so without any reference to the origin of the abbreviation.  Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography was the name of the joint venture of ASM (founded by Arthur del Prado) and Philips Electronics, intended for the development of photolithography machines. 

Did I forget to mention you? Please contact me and I will sort it out.</media:description>

   <media:description>A bit of optics fun and a little riddle: two coherent light beams of equal intensity and opposite phase meet up. They interfere destructively in the center, thereby creating a continuous plane of zero EM field (and so of zero intensity). The question is: how can the energy in either beam cross and area of zero intensity? Leave a comment if you want to show off your intellect ;-).
 
The experiment in the last 20 seconds of the video shows the cross section of 2 laser beams that meet up and part again. For the experiment I used a single coherent source (HeNe-laser), because that is the only way this experiment could work. It requires a fairly high degree of coherence. Basically it's just a 50% beam splitter and an adjustable mirror under 45 degrees, that create 2 beams of equal intensity, initially spaced 4mm apart, 1mm in diameter and are under an angle of 0.1 degrees with respect to each other. I moved the camera sensor over a distance of 6 meters and recorded 40 images around the area where the beams were crossing paths. 

BTW: officially, I think there is no such thing as the "double beam experiment", I just made that name up...</media:description>

   <media:description>This is the first episode about coherence and how this wave phenomenon can cause waves to behave like localized entities.
Unfortunately the quantum (or corpuscular) description of light leads to a lot of confusion. The goal of this video is to describe "quantized" behavior of light purely from wave principles. 

Contents:
0:00 Intro
1:04 Historical perspective
2:58 Quantization and the photoelectric effect
6:42 Light is just waves
7:24 Coherence explained 
12:54 Temporal coherence as a sum of EM-fields
16:47 Coherence length vs. spectral band width
20:25 experiments on the coherence length of light

A sharp viewer noted that there is an error in the formula on the sheet at 27:25 : The product of delta time and delta energy in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not equal to (h*4*pi) but h/(4*pi), so a much smaller value. This also makes the value of delta frequency times delta time 1/(4*pi) not 4*pi Unfortunately I did not double check the values. Thanks for pointing this out Steve. 

In this video short clips of other YouTube channels were used for illustration. Because of their short length and purpose, they are to be considered to be "fair use".

Many thanks to Frans van den Bergh for building this great software tool. Thanks also to Sergey Kotikov (Сергей Котиков), for pointing out the software to me.

The music video was produced by Dr. Liam Fullersheit, who performed the rap, did the arrangements, mixing, and most of the choreography. Whether our CCO actually succeeded in making optics "sexy" and attractive is still the subject of fierce debate within the Huygens Optics organization.
The video clip was made as a tribute to 70s and 80s funk and heavily inspired by the music of Rufus and CK. If you are into this kind of music, please check out their Topic Page: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV-ePMa7s-AqUtVYysArFug. 
In case you need to be mention here as a copyright owner, then please contact me.

Because of multiple requests, I posted the Lyrics of the song below. There were a few concerns about the ambiguity of some of the frases. Dr. Liam reassured me that there was no reason to worry, since it is basically just a song of praise about his favorite camera lens.

"It's 2022 and it's high time
to shine some lights on optics 
My name is Liam, I'm funk optician
I scan the room with my laser vision
You don't need a high power lens to see
I'll have my MTF on MTV

We'll grind all through the night my dear,
until every surface is a perfect sphere
I can feel your fringes when we interfere
So let's transfer modulation right here

The spread function pointing your direction 
Is on an optical axis made for satisfaction
No spectacles needed for you see,
we're a perfect match, chromatically

And dilation is what will occur,
when I focus on your aperture
So if you image me, the way I image you
there are infinite conjugate things to do

Shine your lights on me
I can make you see..anything
I can make you see..anything you want baby
Oh baby, you're so sharp"</media:description>

   <media:description>#shorts, my first one (and maybe my last!)
The video video illustrates how the Electromagnetic field inside a laser beam can locally be made virtually zero creating destructive interference. This is achieved by just placing a pinhole of the right size inside the beam. The size of the pinhole for this experiment is around 25 microns.</media:description>
